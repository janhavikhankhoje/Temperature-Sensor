I worked on a temperature sensor/monitor to model a precision greater than 0.1°C across the calibrated temperature range. This sensor accounts for changes in ambient temperature (20-45°C / 68-113°F) (summer mode) while measuring a body temperature range of 35-42°C / 95-107.6°F. Two thermistors are used to measure surrounding temperature and one is placed horizontally to interface with the wrist.
